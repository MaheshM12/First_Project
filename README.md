*  ## Nature
When I am most awake, most present in the moment,
every sense of nature converges into a *single energetic joy*.
* It is as if there is a feeling passing between each __living thing__, 
+ a bond that is **tangible and blended**,
1. a melody beyond the range of ears but available for the heart.
2. And so, as the each leaf ~moves~ in ~~the wind~~, a part of me does also.
3. It is the **togetherness** of what is separate, the glue in the universe.
